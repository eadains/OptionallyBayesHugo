Today, I'm going to be discussing the difference between two volatility estimators.

# The Data

----


I'm going to be using daily-resolution SPX data from [Sharadar](https://www.quandl.com/publishers/SHARADAR) as well as minute-resolution SPX data from [First Rate Data](https://firstratedata.com/).


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import sqlite3
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from scipy import stats

# Set default figure size
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (15, 10)
```


```python
conn = sqlite3.Connection("data.db")

spx_daily = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM prices WHERE ticker='^GSPC'", conn, index_col="date", parse_dates=["date"])
spx_minute = minute = pd.read_csv("SPX_1min.csv", header=0,names=['datetime', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close'],
                                  index_col='datetime', parse_dates=True)
```


```python
# A quick look at the data
spx_daily.head()
```

# The Estimators

---


Now, what I want to do is compare volatility estimates from these two data sets. I would prefer to use the daily data if possible, because in my case it's easier to get and updates more frequently.

### Garman-Klass Estimator

This estimator has been around for a while and is deemed to be far more effcient than a traditional close-to-close volatility estimator (Garman and Klass, 1980).

From equation 20 in the paper, a jump adjusted volatility estimator:

$$f = 0.73$$ percentage of the day trading is closed based on NYSE hours of 9:30 to 4

$$a = 0.12$$ as they suggest in the paper

$$\sigma^2_{unadj} = 0.511(u - d)^2 - 0.019(c(u+d) - 2ud) - 0.383c^2$$

$$\sigma^2_{adj} = 0.12\frac{(O_{1} - C_{0})^2}{0.73} + 0.12\frac{\sigma^2_{unadj}}{0.27}$$

Where

$$u = H_{1} - O_{1}$$ the normalized high

$$d = L_{1} - O_{1}$$ the normalized low

$$c = C_{1} - O_{1}$$ the normalized close and subscripts indicating time. They also indicate in the paper that these equations expect the log of the price series.


```python
def gk_vol_calc(data):
    u = np.log(data['high']) - np.log(data['open'])
    d = np.log(data['low']) - np.log(data['open'])
    c = np.log(data['close']) - np.log(data['open'])
    vol_unadj = 0.511 * (u - d)**2 - 0.019 * (c * (u + d) - 2 * u * d) - 0.283 * c**2
    
    jumps = np.log(data['open']) - np.log(data['close'].shift(1))
    vol_adj = 0.12 * (jumps**2 / 0.73) + 0.12 * (vol_unadj / 0.27)
    
    return vol_adj
```


```python
# Let's take a look
gk_vol = np.sqrt(gk_vol_calc(spx_daily))
gk_vol.plot()
```








{{< figure src="./output_11_1.png" >}}
    


As an aside, opening jumps have become more common and larger in recent years, maybe something to investigate. This is as a percentage, so it's not a simple case of the index values becoming larger.


```python
(spx_daily['open'] / spx_daily['close'].shift(1) - 1).plot()
```








{{< figure src="./output_13_1.png" >}}
    


### Realized Volatility Estimator

This estimator is very simply and has become more prominent in the literature in the last few years because of increasing availability of higher-frequency data. Based on (Liu, Patton, and Sheppard, 2012), it's hard to beat a 5-minute RV. Here, I'm going to use a 1-minute estimator, which is also shown to be effective.

$$RV_{t} = \sum_{k=1}^n r_{t,k}^2$$ where the t index is each day, and the k index represents each intraday return

For daily volatility, it's simply a sum of squared returns from within that day. So in this case we calculate returns for each 1 minute period, square them, and they sum them for each day.


```python
def rv_calc(data):
    results = {}
    
    for idx, data in data.groupby(data.index.date):
        returns = np.log(data['close']) - np.log(data['close'].shift(1))
        results[idx] = np.sum(returns**2)
        
    return pd.Series(results)
```


```python
# Let's take a look at this one
rv = np.sqrt(rv_calc(spx_minute))
rv.plot()
```








{{< figure src="./output_16_1.png" >}}
    


# Comparisons

---



```python
# Because the minute data has a shorter history, let's match them up
gk_vol = gk_vol.reindex(rv.index)
```


```python
rv.plot()
gk_vol.plot()
```








{{< figure src="./output_19_1.png" >}}
    


Here's a plot of our two different volatility estimators with RV in blue and Garman-Klass in orange. The RV estimator is far less noisy, looking at each of their graphs above. The Garman-Klass estimator also seems to persistently return a lower result than RV. This is backed up by looking at a graph of their difference.


```python
(gk_vol - rv).plot()
```








{{< figure src="./output_21_1.png" >}}
    


Netx, let's analyze how they do at normalizing the returns of the S&P 500. According to (Moln√°r, 2015) normalizing a number of equity returns by their Garman-Klass estimated volatility does indeed make their distributions normal. Let's see if we can replicate that result with either of our esimates on the S&P 500.


```python
# Daily close-to-close returns of the S&P 500
spx_returns = np.log(spx_daily['close']) - np.log(spx_daily['close'].shift(1))
spx_returns = spx_returns.reindex(rv.index)
```


```python
# Normalizing by our estimated volatilties
gk_vol_norm = (spx_returns / gk_vol).dropna()
rv_norm = (spx_returns / rv).dropna()
```


```python
# Here are the unadjusted returns
_, _, _ = plt.hist(spx_returns, bins=50)
```


{{< figure src="./output_25_0.png" >}}
    



```python
# Here's normalized by the Garman-Klass Estimator
_, _, _ = plt.hist(gk_vol_norm, bins=50)
```


{{< figure src="./output_26_0.png" >}}
    



```python
# And this is by the RV estimator
_, _, _ = plt.hist(rv_norm, bins=50)
```


{{< figure src="./output_27_0.png" >}}
    


At first glance, the RV adjusted returns seem most like normal to me, let's run some tests. These Scipy tests set the null hypothesis that the data comes from a corresponding normal distribution. So if the p-value is small we can reject that hypothesis and conclude the distribution is non-normal.


```python
print(stats.skewtest(gk_vol_norm))
print(stats.skewtest(rv_norm))
```

```text
    Garman-Klass Skew: SkewtestResult(statistic=-0.3767923327324783, pvalue=0.7063279391177064)
    RV-5min Skew: SkewtestResult(statistic=5.251294175425576, pvalue=1.5103423951480544e-07)
```


```python
print(stats.kurtosistest(gk_vol_norm))
print(stats.kurtosistest(rv_norm))
```

```text
    KurtosistestResult(statistic=-13.088609427904334, pvalue=3.825472809774632e-39)
    KurtosistestResult(statistic=0.315320709120601, pvalue=0.7525181628202805)
```

Looks like the Garman-Klass-normalized returns have normal skew, but non-normal kurtosis. The RV-normalized returns have non-normal skew but normal kurtosis! There's no winning here! Both are non-normal in different ways. Either normalization does do better than the unadjusted returns though.


```python
print(stats.skewtest(spx_returns.dropna()))
print(stats.kurtosistest(spx_returns.dropna()))
```

```text
    SkewtestResult(statistic=-12.386230904806132, pvalue=3.1028724633560147e-35)
    KurtosistestResult(statistic=26.470418979318143, pvalue=2.124045513612033e-154)
```

# Conclusion

---


While from a statistical point of view, neither option seems particularly favorable, my personal choice is going to be the RV estimator. I think the literature is clear on its efficacy and its less noisy and conceptually easier. It's been said that when there are a bunch of competing theories, none of them are very good. So I'll pick the simplest option and go with RV.
